## Overview

### The goal

Building a short game with a combat system, animations, sound effects, and linear storyline.

## My process

### Built with

- Godot 3.5.1
- LibreSprite
- Assets from itch.io

### What I learned

This project's an implementation of everything I've learned about both Godot 3.x and game design so far. Everything from the more technical stuff about creating animations, pathfinding, enemy AI etc. to designing art, levels, and menus.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on making the combat more fun, as well as implement various weapon/stat upgrades and a save option. Making a side scroller with high scores also seems like a fun idea.

### Useful resources

- [HeartBeast's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@uheartbeast) is a great source for Godot tutorials
- [AdamCYounis's videos](https://www.youtube.com/@AdamCYounis) were incredibly helpful in understanding the basics of pixel art to make a few of my own sprites

- There was also an Estonian streamer on Twitch who was coding an RPG in Unity months (possibly years?) ago, I can't for the life of me find his channel anymore but I remember it being my first experience actually watching a game be made in front of me.
